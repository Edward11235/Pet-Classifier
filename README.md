# Pet-Classifier 🐶🐱🐰
This is an ios app that can distinguish among Cat, Dog, and Rabbit in a given picture

The machine learning model is built by me with Create ML of Apple. 

How to use:
1, Clone it to your Xcode.
2, Run the app on your physical iphone/ipad (or you cannot take a picture)
3, Use the photo and the app will tell you what pet (a dog, a cat, or a rabbit) is in the picture.

drawback:
Currently, the app is silly when the picture has no pets at all. So I shall deal with it.
